# Research- An Empirical study of Precision Agriculture

I worked on plant leaf disease detection.I utilized a plant leaf dataset to perform feature extraction using GLCM.
For feature selection, I performed correlation analysis to identify relevant features, avoiding overfitting and enhancing model performance.
I employed classification algorithms such as SVM, Gaussian SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, and also used ensemble methods, which resulted in improved accuracy. 
For performance evaluation, I used a confusion matrix and calculated metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 score.
